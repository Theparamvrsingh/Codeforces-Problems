The idea behind the approach is, 

if a number % 3 == 1 or 2 then Vanya can either add 1 or subtract 1 to make it divisible by3
so here just simply check if num%3 != 0 then FIRST

if a number is already divisble by 3 then either add 1 or subtract 1 will make it non divisible so
here simple vova will win SECOND
